For our study of climate change and temperature anomalies we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). 

We use the following code to load our data.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           
           skip = 1, 
           
           na = "***")

```

```{r}
skim(weather)
```

After taking a first look at the weather data set, we clean our data by dropping variables we do not need and by bringing our data to the longer (tidy) format.

```{r tidyweather}

tidyweather <- weather %>%
  
  select(-"J-D",-"D-N",-"DJF",-"MAM",-"JJA",-"SON") %>%
  
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13,
               
               names_to = "month",
               
               values_to = "delta")
```

```{r}
skim(tidyweather)
```

Our new dataframe now has three variables, one each for 

1. year, 
2. month, and 
3. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

We plotted the data using a time-series scatter plot, and added a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 

```{r scatter_plot}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5)+
  
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )+
  
  labs (
    
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    
    subtitle = "Development of temperature deviations",
    
    x = "Year",
    
    y = "Temperature Deviation"
    )

```

> Above plot displays an increase in weather anomalies over time.

As the plot above only provides limited information, we will plot the same data faceted by month in order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the data.

```{r facet_wrap}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  
  geom_point()+
  
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  
  theme_bw() +
  
  facet_wrap("month") +
  
  labs (
    
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    
    subtitle = "Development of temperature deviations",
    
    x = "Year",
    
    y = "Monthly Temperature Deviation"
    )

```

> Generally, the plot displays a rise in temperature anomalies in all twelve months. However, it seems like weather anomalies are in average more likely to arise in winter and spring months than in the summer. Beyond that, the colder months display a higher deviation from the mean, represented by the distance of the points from the respective lines.

It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. Hence, in the following, we create a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

In that regard, we remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

comparison

```

We now use the `interval` variable to create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in.

```{r density_plot}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +
  
  theme_bw() +   
  
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    
    y     = "Density"
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages

average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>%
  
  #grouping data by Year
  
  group_by(Year) %>%
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:

ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Weather Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )                         


```

> The above plot shows that in the past c. 60 years the climate faced a 1 degree change which is significant considering the impact of small changes in temperature on the overall climate.

## Confidence Interval for `delta`

After visualizing our data, we construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011 using two different approaches.

### 1. Formula

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

formula_ci <- comparison %>%
  
  filter(interval=="2011-present") %>%
  
     summarise(mean = mean(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
                         SD = sd(delta, na.rm = TRUE),
                         count=n(),
                         SE = SD/sqrt(count),
                         lower_ci = mean - 1.96*SE,
                         upper_ci = mean + 1.96*SE)

formula_ci %>%
  
  kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the Annual Delta since 2011')%>%
  
  kable_styling()

```

### 2. Bootstrap simulation using `infer` package

```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta

# calculating confidence interval with bootstrapping

bootstrap_delta <- comparison %>%
  
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%
  
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  
  calculate(stat = "mean")

infer_ci <- bootstrap_delta %>%
  
  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95,type = "percentile")

infer_ci %>%
  
  kbl(caption = 'Confidence Interval for the Annual Delta since 2011 using bootstrapping')%>%
  
  kable_styling()

```

> From the analysis of the sample database, we are 95% confident that the interval (0.915, 1.02) captures the true population mean. In other words, if we make 20 repeated observations and calculate 95% confidence intervals for each observation, we can expect that around 19 of those intervals will contain the true annual delta since 2011.
